# Weather and AQI Correlation Analysis in Da Nang

This project is a collaborative effort between myself and the owner of this repository. The main goal is to analyze the correlation between various weather parameters and the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the Da Nang region and to develop predictions based on this analysis.

## Objectives
- Understand the relationships between weather factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and AQI levels specific to Da Nang.
- Use statistical methods and machine learning to build predictive models for AQI in this region.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection**: Gather weather data and AQI measurements from reliable sources relevant to Da Nang.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends, patterns, and any significant observations in the data.
3. **Modeling**: Develop predictive models to estimate AQI based on weather factors.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance and accuracy of the models for practical application in Da Nang.
